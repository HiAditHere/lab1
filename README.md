This lab focuses on 5 modules, which includes creating a virtual environment, creating a GitHub repository, creating Python files, creating test files using pytest and unittest, and implementing GitHub Actions.



## Step 1: Creating a Virtual Environment

In software development, it's crucial to manage project dependencies and isolate your project's environment from the global Python environment. This isolation ensures that your project remains consistent, stable, and free from conflicts with other Python packages or projects. To achieve this, we create a virtual environment dedicated to our project. <br>
<br>
To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal in the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Choose a name for your virtual environment (e.g "lab_01") and run the appropriate command:
    ```
    python -m venv lab_01
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment
    ```
    lab01\Scripts\activate
    ```
After activation, you will see the virtual environment's name in your command prompt or terminal, indicating that you are working within the virtual environment.


## Step 2: Creating a GitHub Repository, Cloning and Folder Structure
Now that we have set up our virtual environment, the next step is to create a GitHub repository for our project and establish a structured folder layout. This organization helps maintain your project's code, data, and tests in an organized manner.

### Creating a GitHub Repository
- Open a web browser and go to GitHub.
- In the upper right corner, click the "+" button and select "New repository."
- Choose a name for your repository.
- Choose the visibility of your repositoryâ€”either public (visible to everyone) or private (accessible only to selected collaborators)
- Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box. This will create an initial README file that you can edit to provide project documentation.
- Click the "Create repository" button.

### Cloning the Repository
- Open a Command Prompt or Terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone your GitHub repository. This should be the same directory where you created your virtual environment.
- Run the following command to clone your GitHub repository into the current directory:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
- Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this URL on your GitHub repository's main page.
After running the command, the repository will be cloned, and you'll have a local copy of your GitHub project in your chosen directory.

### Establishing Folder Structure
- Once you have cloned yor repository, you can establish a structured folder layout within it. This layout helps organize your project into key directories for code, data, and tests. Create the following subfolders within your repository: <br>
- data: This folder is used for storing project data files or datasets. <br>
- src: This folder is where you'll store your project's source code files. <br>
- test: This folder is dedicated to unit tests and test scripts for your code. <br>
- Create a file named .gitignore. This is useful to exclude the virtual environment and other unnecessary files from version control.
- Add the virtual environment folder name inside your gitignore file so that its not tracked by Git.

### Adding and Pushing Your Project Code to GitHub
Now that we have our virtual environment set up, the GitHub repository created, and the folder structure organized, let's add our project's code and push it to GitHub. 

**Adding Your Project Code** <br>
- Navigate to your project directory using the Command Prompt or Terminal, where you have the virtual environment and folder structure set up.
- Create and write your Python code or other project files within the specified directories (src, data, etc.) according to your project requirements.
- Once your project files are ready, it's time to add them to Git's staging area. In your project directory, run the following command:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
- This command stages all the changes and new files in your project directory for the next commit.

**Committing Your Changes** <br>
- After staging your changes, commit them with a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made. Replace <your_commit_message> with a descriptive message:
    ```
    git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
    ```

**Pushing to GitHub** <br>
- To push your committed changes to your GitHub repository, use the following command:
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```
## Step 3: Creating calculator.py in src Folder
- In this step, we create a Python script named calculator.py within the src folder of your project. This script contains a set of mathematical functions designed to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- fun1(x, y) adds two input numbers, x and y.
- fun2(x, y) subtracts y from x.
- fun3(x, y) multiplies x and y.
- fun4(x, y) combines the results of the above functions and returns their sum.
- To view the code and gain a deeper understanding, please refer to the calculator.py file located under the src folder in this [link](https://github.com/shankar-dh/Github-actions/blob/main/src/calculator.py).

## Step 4: Creating tests using Pytest and Unittests
- In this step, we'll set up unit tests for the functions in our calculator.py script using two popular testing frameworks: [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). Unit testing ensures that individual components of your code work as expected, helping you catch and fix bugs early in the development process.

**Using pytest** <br>
- Installation (if not already installed):
- If you haven't already installed pytest, you can do so using pip:
    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```
### Writing Pytest Tests
- Let's create a test file named test_pytest.py within the test folder. This file will contain a series of test functions, each aimed at verifying the behavior of specific functions within calculator.py.
- We've prepared four test functions (test_fun1, test_fun2, test_fun3, and test_fun4) to test the functions within calculator.py. Each test function uses the assert statement to validate the expected outcomes. Refer the file under test folder for your [reference](https://github.com/shankar-dh/Github-actions/blob/main/test/test_pytest.py).
